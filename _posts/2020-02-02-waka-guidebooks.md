There's a lot more to a transport network than maps and timetables. Each city has its own quirks, and you'll often only discover these by experiencing them for yourself. Even the smallest things such as paying a fare can be confusing if you've never done it before.

That's why we're introducing local guidebooks in Waka. These are local guides to help you understand your city's transport and get around more effectively. They're designed to be super handy if you've never used the network before, but you might still learn a thing or two if you're a long-time user! They're also a quick & easy reference to things like zones & fares. Additionally, these guides are open source and *editable by anyone!*

*Te Whanganui-a-Tara, Wellington* is our first city with a guidebook. We've currently just got the basics in there - some fare information, and how to get to the airport. We would love to [get your feedback](https://waka.app/feedback) to see what you think and decide whether we should roll out these guides to more cities!
