You can now send us feedback inside Waka! You can get there from the home page, or by heading to [waka.app/feedback](https://waka.app/feedback). You'll also be able offered to provide feedback if Waka crashes in any way. We really value your feedback, so we would love to hear what you think.

There's also been a few changes behind the scenes. We've made a few minor layout improvements to support devices that are larger than phones, but smaller than tablets - the Galaxy Fold is one example. We've also moved our infrastructure off Amazon ECS, and onto [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) on Digital Ocean. It makes our lives easier, but hopefully you don't notice a difference!
