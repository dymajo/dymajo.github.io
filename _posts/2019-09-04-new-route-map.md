We've added a great new route map to Waka today. After choosing a line from the routes page, or a service from a station, you'll now have an overview of all the next departures.

You're able to see long it takes to get to each station, and transfers you can make at each station. To view services in other directions, or with different stopping patterns, you can tap the route icon in the top corner.

We hope you love using the new route map! 

We also did a lot of housekeeping to prepare for adding more new cities. Please see the following GitHub releases for code changes:
